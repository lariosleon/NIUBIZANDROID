You shall:
(i)	Except in respect of the Redistributables as embedded in the Application, not sublicense, transfer, sell or otherwise communicate or make available the SOFTWARE to any third party and shall protect and secure the SOFTWARE using the same degree of care you use to protect your own proprietary rights, but in any case not less than reasonable care;

You shall at all times comply with the Documentation in particular in respect of the development rules relating to communications and compartmentalization of applications.

You acknowledge that it may be necessary to prepare the environment within which the SOFTWARE will be used, including but not limited to parameterization of the devices or computer programs with which the SOFTWARE will be used, integrated or interfaced.

You warrant that the Applications are at the time they are released, compatible with INGENICO’s applications, and do not infringe any third party intellectual property rights.
